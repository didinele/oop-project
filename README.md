# oop-project - Chess GUI

## Build

This project uses CMake. To build the project the following commands can be used:
```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -B build
$ cd build
$ cmake --build .
```

Once built, the executable can be immediately ran, on MacOS and Linux simply using `./chess`, while on Windows
it can be found under `Debug\chess.exe`.
